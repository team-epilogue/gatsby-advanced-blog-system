In Asian\nsupermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted\ncharcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 650px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/e1596/salty_egg.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 74.84662576687117%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMB/8QAFwEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEBf/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABgik0dWC//8QAGRABAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACERJC/9oACAEBAAEFAkqW7B5Zovtvk//EABcRAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREkH/2gAIAQMBAT8B1WX/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAESL/2gAIAQIBAT8BjT//xAAbEAABBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRISIxMv/aAAgBAQAGPwK9GNocyS8hCj//xAAaEAADAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhQYGx/9oACAEBAAE/IXOrA43oOyg9wgU86OZMfwZKypT/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEMjv/8QAFxEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIf/aAAgBAwEBPxARwyusv//EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAIVH/2gAIAQIBAT8QOoVoX//EAB0QAQEAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAERADFhgSFB0eH/2gAIAQEAAT8QSpwaGjrBSrtHyF9iY8RpUnGRBGqtOcsiDE6fM3AgiXf5M//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"\n        title=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"\n        src=\"/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/6aca1/salty_egg.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/d2f63/salty_egg.jpg 163w,\n/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/c989d/salty_egg.jpg 325w,\n/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/6aca1/salty_egg.jpg 650w,\n/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/7c09c/salty_egg.jpg 975w,\n/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/01ab0/salty_egg.jpg 1300w,\n/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/e1596/salty_egg.jpg 2048w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>You can also write code blocks here!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const saltyDuckEgg = \"chinese preserved food product\"\n</code></pre>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Number</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Title</th>\n<th align=\"right\">Year</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</td>\n<td align=\"right\">2001</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</td>\n<td align=\"right\">2002</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">3</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</td>\n<td align=\"right\">2004</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><a href=\"https://raw.github.com/adamschwartz/github-markdown-kitchen-sink/master/README.md\">View raw (TEST.md)</a></p>\n<p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n<pre><code>This is a paragraph.\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Header 1</h1>\n<h2>Header 2</h2>\n<pre><code>Header 1\n========\n\nHeader 2\n--------\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Header 1</h1>\n<h2>Header 2</h2>\n<h3>Header 3</h3>\n<h4>Header 4</h4>\n<h5>Header 5</h5>\n<h6>Header 6</h6>\n<pre><code># Header 1\n## Header 2\n### Header 3\n#### Header 4\n##### Header 5\n###### Header 6\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Header 1</h1>\n<h2>Header 2</h2>\n<h3>Header 3</h3>\n<h4>Header 4</h4>\n<h5>Header 5</h5>\n<h6>Header 6</h6>\n<pre><code># Header 1 #\n## Header 2 ##\n### Header 3 ###\n#### Header 4 ####\n##### Header 5 #####\n###### Header 6 ######\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
