To protect these fragile islands, only 460 tourists are allowed to visit these unspoiled beauties per day. And you’ll definitely want to include Fernando de Noronha on your itinerary if you can. Conde Nast called this archipelago “possibly the most relaxing and most beautiful place” in the world. And the New York Times included Fernando de Noronha on its 2014 list of must-visit destinations. This high praise is well deserved. The waters around Fernando de Noronha are crystal clear and teeming with fish, dolphins and turtles, making them perfect for snorkeling and diving. You’ll also find plenty of lovely, deserted beaches, pretty coves and lovely waterfalls on these very special and very exclusive islands.</p>\n<p>Image credits: <a href=\"https://www.touropia.com/islands-in-brazil/\">touropia.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.touropia.com/islands-in-brazil/\">Original content</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fernando de Noronha","date":"January 10, 2018","author":"touropia.com","tags":["Pernanbuco","Nordeste","Favorite"],"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/c58bf5525e0526d5a1ca646f0d28d1d6/14b42/fernando_de_noronha.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018/01/10/fernando-de-noronha","next":{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018/01/09/ilha-grande"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ilha Grande","date":"2018-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","author":"touropia.com","tags":["Rio de Janeiro","Sudeste"],"featured":false,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/fd0e06f1df2df33bc4a1ba28c7b9ada4/14b42/ilha_grande.jpg"}}}},"html":"<p>If you’re looking for an island that has remained largely undeveloped, consider visiting Ilha Grande, which is located approximately 160 km (100 miles) from Rio de Janeiro. Over the years, this island has been used for some interesting purposes. It was once a leper colony, and for more than 90 years it was also a prison that housed some of Brazil’s worst criminals. But once the prison shut down in 1994, it started to attract tourists, who are drawn to this island by its beautiful beaches and amazing rain forests. And because Ilha Grande is a nature preserve, it is home to incredible wildlife, including monkeys, parrots, iguanas and capybaras.</p>\n<p>Image credits: <a href=\"https://www.touropia.com/islands-in-brazil/\">touropia.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.touropia.com/islands-in-brazil/\">Original content</a></p>"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","712016698"]}
