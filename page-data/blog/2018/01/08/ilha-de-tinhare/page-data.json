Over the years, this island has been used for some interesting purposes. It was once a leper colony, and for more than 90 years it was also a prison that housed some of Brazil’s worst criminals. But once the prison shut down in 1994, it started to attract tourists, who are drawn to this island by its beautiful beaches and amazing rain forests.
